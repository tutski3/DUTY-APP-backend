# Backend Application

This is the backend part of our project. It provides the server and API for the frontend to interact with. The backend is built with Node.js and uses various libraries and tools to handle data, authentication, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

- Database: You may need a database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB, depending on the project requirements. Ensure it is set up and running.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-repo.git

Navigate to the project directory:cd backend-repo
Install the dependencies:npm install


Configuration
Database: Set up your database connection and credentials in the project's configuration files (e.g., config.js).

Authentication: If your project requires user authentication, make sure to configure the authentication method (e.g., Passport.js).

API Routes: Define and configure API routes for your project in the appropriate files (e.g., routes/api.js).
